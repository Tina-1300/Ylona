Welcome to the Ylona project documentation : 

The Ylona project was created because, on Windows, I find the C++ API to be quite complex to use. Being passionate about creating libraries, I explored everything that could be done in C++ via the Windows API. I chose to work on audio volume management because it requires few features, while still providing practical utility.

The features I identified are:

- Change the volume.
- Recover current volume.
- Check if the sound is muted or not.
- Activate or deactivate mute.

However, implementing these features requires writing a lot of code with the Windows API, which can quickly become tedious. Using my library, you can significantly reduce the amount of code you have to write, while still achieving the same result.

By using Ylona, ​​your code will not only be more readable, but also more pleasant to write!
